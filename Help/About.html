          What is a CanSat
      </h2>
      <p>
        A can-sized satellite is a crucial fundamental practical experience, which creates an opportunity
        to explore aerospace as one of the challenging technologies. The can-sat as it is shortly
        written, was firstly introduced by professor Bob Twiggs in November 1998 at the university
        space systems symposium (USSS) for the purpose of providing an affordable way to acquire
        the researchers with the basic knowledge to many challenges in building a satellite.

      <h2>
          What is a CanSat Ground Station
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ground stations are surface-based facilities which are designed to provide 
        real-time communication with satellites. The crew at these stations send radio 
        signals to the satellite (uplink), receive data transmissions from the satellite (downlink), 
        and in some cases,serve as command and control centers for the satellite network. 
        From the ground station, data can be analyzed (or relayed to another location for analysis), 
        the altitude and movement of the satellite and information about its critical systems 
        can be monitored, and satellites can be controlled by decision makers.

          A note on this Graphical User Interface
      </h2>
      <p>
      This Graphical User Interface(GUI) is written in python.It stands for a simple Ground Station for a can-sat. 
      not all the components of the components of the GUI is written in python some are written in html. This GUI provides
      different functionality which can allow easy access and control of the can-sat. such functionality include 
      different commands which provides the tasks to be performed by the CanSat, the GUI also allow easy access
      satellite collected data.
